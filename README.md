Algorithm Visualizer

This project visualizes how search algorithms work step by step.

It supports:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

The goal of this project is to clearly understand how algorithm state changes
during execution rather than focusing on animation or UI.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
